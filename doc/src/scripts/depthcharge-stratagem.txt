usage: depthcharge-stratagem -a <address> -f <infile> -s <type> -P <payload file> -o <outfile>

Create a Stratagem file, given a memory or flash dump and a desired payload.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -a <value>, --address <value>
                        Base address of image.
  -f <path>, --file <path>
                        Input file containing memory or flash image
  -s <type>, --stratagem <type>
                        Type of the Stratagem to produce
  -P PAYLOAD, --payload PAYLOAD
                        File containing desired binary payload
  -o <path>, --outfile <path>
                        Output file to store produced Stratagem in
  -X <key>[=<value>], --extra <key>[=<value>]
                        Parameters passed to Hunter implementation used for
                        Stratagem creation.
  -l, --list            List supported Stratagem types and their -X
                        parameters.

notes:
    In Depthcharge parlance, a "Stratagem" is a sequence of meta-operations
    used to perform a desired operation, such as writing a specific value to
    a target region, abusing U-boot functionality not intended for this.

    In general, a subset of Depthcharge "Hunter" implementations are used
    to search for and produce these Stratagem.

    The available Hunter-specific settings that can be specified using -X/--extra
    can be found in the output of depthcharge-stratagem --list. Refer to the
    corresponding depthcharge.hunter.Hunter subclass for more information
    about these "extra" parameters, which correspond to the keyword arguments
    (**kwargs) their constructors and methods support.

    In general, use of this script will require an understanding of the
    corresponding Depthcharge Hunter and Stratagem API items.

example:
    Create a Depthcharge Stratagem for use with a CRC32MemoryWriter:
        depthcharge-stratagem -f dump.bin -s crc32 -P payload.bin -o stratagem.json

    Consider a situation where the above command reports a failure to produce a
    Stratagem. We can use the -X, --extra argument to both expend more memory when
    searching for a result (via `revlut_maxlen`) and permit longer-running deploy-time
    operations (via `max_iterations). Below is an example -X usage that would
    increase the defaults used by Depthcharge's CRC32MemoryWriter:

        -X revlut_maxlen=512,max_iterations=8192
