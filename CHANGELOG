2020-07-21: Depthcharge Release 0.1.0 ("Against the Grain")
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial public release of Depthcharge.

Versions:

    Python module (`depthcharge`): 0.1.0
    Companion Firmware: 0.1.0

Current limitations:

    - Supports ARM (32-bit) only. Additional architecture support can be
        introduced via python/depthcharge/arch.py.

    - The Companion Firmware currently acts only as an I2C peripheral.
      This can certainly be expanded upon to also act as a SPI peripheral.

    - GoExecutor is the only Executor implementation. Boot commands could also
      be leveraged as such, provided that payloads are wrapped in appropriate
      image formats, preferably automatically by Depthcharge.
